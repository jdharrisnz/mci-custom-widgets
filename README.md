# Custom Widgets for Marketing Cloud Intelligence
Custom widgets are used in Marketing Cloud Intelligence to create novel utilities and data visualisations to satisfy unique use cases.

They're created by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to interact with data supplied to the widget.

This repository contains widgets I've developed myself, including `utils.js`, a library of many useful functions for custom widget development. All of my widgets are designed to be easy to set up and dynamically respond to the data input - no coding skills required.

Setup instructions are in each of the above folders.

Please feel free to load issues here if you find any bugs. Loading feature requests as "issues" is fine, but remember they will be privately noted and the issue closed.
